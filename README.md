# Crystal Rift - a dart 2D game engine

An HTML5 2D game engine using dart and canvas. Movements and interactions are like Zelda.

[Live demo here](http://foxxor.github.io/crystalrift-dart/gameengine.html)

## What is working?

* Character movement in 4 directions. (W,A,S,D)
* Camera following main character.
* Character collission detection.
* Pushable elements.
* Buildings, characters, items and decorations are loaded dinamically using json files.
* Map tilesets, each tile can have a different graphic and collision rule.
* Character to character interaction. (Enter)
* Actions handling. (On-screen text, framed-animations)
* Particle effects like fire, poison, smoke.(Little buggy still trying to figure out some things on dart)
* Text boxes for long texts. (Enter to skip)

## Additional Utils in the repository

* Tile selector utility, click on any tile of the tileset to retrieve the x,y coordinates.

### TODO

* ~~Create visual elements~~
* ~~Create complex visual elements~~
* Different maps handling
* ~~Camera movement with main character~~
* ~~Text boxes for characters~~
* ~~Character interactions~~
* Character special actions (Jump, teleport, flip?)
* Lots of things...Items, Battle, Menus.
* Fix particles

### Want to help?

Do you think you can do something better or improve the existing?

Go ahead! I just started with Dart and I'm not a Dart jedi, any help is appreciated.
