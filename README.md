# Crystal Rift - a dart 2D game engine

An HTML5 game engine using dart and canvas. I'm planning to convert this into a Zelda style game.

## TODO

* Create visual elements
* Create complex visual elements
* Different maps handling
* Camera movement with main character
* Text boxes for characters
* Character interactions
* Character special actions (Jump, teleport, flip?)
* Lots of things...Items, Battle, Menus.
