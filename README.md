# Crystal Rift - a dart 2D game engine

An HTML5 game engine using dart and canvas. I'm planning to convert this into a Zelda style game.

[Live demo here](http://foxxor.github.io/crystalrift-dart/gameengine.html)

## What is working?

* Character movement in 4 directions. (W,A,S,D)
* Character collission detection. (Buggy when the movement is fast)
* Pushable elements.
* Buildings, characters, items and decorations are loaded dinamically using json files.
* Map tilesets, each tile can have a different graphic and collision rule.
* Character to character interaction. (Enter)
* Actions handling. (Only text on screen at the moment)

## Additional Utils in the repository

* Tile selector utility, click on any tile of the tileset to retrieve the x,y coordinates.

### TODO

* ~~Create visual elements~~
* Create complex visual elements
* Different maps handling
* Camera movement with main character
* ~~Text boxes for characters~~ (Not fully working)
* ~~Character interactions~~
* Character special actions (Jump, teleport, flip?)
* Lots of things...Items, Battle, Menus.

### Want to help?

Do you think you can do something better or improve the existing?

Go ahead! I just started with Dart and I'm not a jedi, any help is appreciated.
